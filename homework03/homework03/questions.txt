Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.
  - service was RESTful for this homework assignment. The database I used with this 
  homework assignment was Firebase, where you create a class for the database entering in the config 
code firebase has created for you. The key features of making this RESTful are 
  - allows user to access and add in their own input or information
  - has fast performance and reliability
  - database can be identified by their URL they create for the programmer to use and connect

  - for nullipotent actions, no matter how many times you refresh the page you will still
  have the same list
